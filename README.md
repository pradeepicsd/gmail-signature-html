# 📬 How to Create and Add a Gmail Signature

This will walk you through creating a Gmail signature using plain text, links, and emoji icons — all Gmail-compatible.

---

## ✍️ Step 1: Prepare Your Signature Content

Create the signature in HTML format (However Gmail does not support HTML as input but you can copy the formatting from browser and paste it into Gmail signature settings).

### ✅ This is an example:

```
Pradeep Vishwakarma  
Python Developer | Backend & DevOps  
📞 +1 (234) 567-890  
🔗 GitHub | LinkedIn | Portfolio
```

## 🔗 Step 2: Add Clickable Links in Gmail

1. Open **[Gmail](https://mail.google.com)**.
2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** in the top right → **See all settings**.
3. Under the **General** tab, scroll down to **"Signature"**.
4. Click **"Create new"**, give it a name (e.g., "Professional").
5. Paste your signature content into the box.
6. For links (like GitHub, LinkedIn, phone number):
   - Highlight the text (e.g., `GitHub`)
   - Click the 🔗 **link icon**
   - Enter the full URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername`)
   - For phone numbers, use format: `tel:+1234567890`
7. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom.

## 📌 Optional Tips

- **Avoid using external icons/images** — Gmail doesn't embed them, and many email clients block them.
- **Use emojis** (📞, 🔗, 💼) to add visual interest without breaking compatibility.
- Test your signature by sending an email to yourself before using it professionally.
